## Post-Installation

1. Inside bin, you will find visualizer, simulator, and hw0
   ```
   ./hw0 &
   ./visualizer &
   ```
   Note this opens up the applications in the background, use "jobs" to see currently running jobs and "fg" or "bg" to foreground next job or background next job
   
1.5 You can also run the script inside the bin folder "run_hw0.sh" to run hw0. Ctrl-c on the shell to quit.
   
2. Read the source code of hw0 inside src/hw0/hw0.cpp and the URDF file src/RRPbot.urdf and src/world.urdf to understand what is happening inside the robot code and how the simple robot is described both kinematically and graphically.
